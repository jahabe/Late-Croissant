Predicting High-Impact Sidewalk Barriers That Disrupt Everyday Movement in Seattle

Goal
--
We use sidewalk accessibility data and a simple ML model to identify persistent, high-severity barriers that most disrupt independent daily movement, helping cities prioritize repairs with limited resources. 

Problem Statement 
--
The real problem: 
* A single severe, permanent barrier can: force long detours, block crossings, remove independence
* Cities cannot fix everything at once.

**The decision gap:**
Which barriers should be fixed first to reduce the most daily mobility friction?


User & Stakeholder
--
Primary user: City planners/ transportation department 
Indirect users: Wheelchair users, elderly pedestrians, families with strollers 
Why this matters: repair budgets are limited. Prioritization today is often reactive, not data-driven.
